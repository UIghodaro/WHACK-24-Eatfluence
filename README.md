# WHACK-24: Eatfluence - You Hungry Yet?
A website project created for Warwick Hack 2024. Created as a team of 2 using HTML, CSS and some Javascript for front-end and then python and Fetch.AI APIs for back-end.

## Features & Vision
The website was created to take in an input location/city of the users choice, before using Fetch.AI APIs to scrape trendy restaurants from Tik Tok that are in said area. 

The site would then present these restaurants to the user alongside stats about the restaurants and a link to the specific post the restaurant was taken from. 

The website was mostly created, however back-end compatibility was not finished. the downloaded zip is only a demo and will show the same restaurants regardless of inputted area.

## Setup
1. Download and extract the zip.
2. The website can be viewed by opening the HTMLs stored in the templates file
3. The backend python can be viewed by opening the backend folder and opening the resulting files
